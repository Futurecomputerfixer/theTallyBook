# THE TALLY BOOK
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/pNPogxpnZtI
#### Description:
The TALLYBOOK is a tool to help users keep track of their spending. Nowadays, many things we dream about require a lot of
financial assets; therefore, being able to manage one's finance is a key capability that everyone needs to learn. THE TALLYBOOK is created to be a helper. This website was intended to be hosting on heroku hosting server, but the local database disconnects from heroku. Now it is served through flask. The index page is to present the mainpage, summary for a pie chart of the spending,
entry for entering new expense, category for creating new category. The app.py is the controller, importing "connect()" from helpers which is used to connect python with postgreSQL. I also picked a cute yellow duck(which is actually the prototype of the rubber duck debugging) to be the favicon. Hope this web application works well!
