# THE TALLY BOOK
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/pNPogxpnZtI
#### Description:
The TALLYBOOK is a tool to help users keep track of their spending. Nowadays, many things we dream about require a lot of money such as houses and cars; therefore, being able to manage one's finance is a key capability that everyone needs to learn. THE TALLYBOOK is created to be a helper. This project is served through flask framework and uses sqlite as the database. The index page is to present the mainpage, summary for a pie chart of the spending, entry for entering new expense, category for creating new category. The app.py is the controller, importing "connect()" from helpers which is used to connect python with sqlite. I also picked a cute yellow duck(which is actually the prototype of the rubber duck debugging) to be the favicon. Hope this program works well!
